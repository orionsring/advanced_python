    web based application using bootsrap 4.
Recommended to go to web2py.com and install.
You can then run a server from the web2py.exe 
after launching the application it comes with 
many pre-made files and folders, many of which
are named in this repository.
    There are many differences in the default 
and that which is listed in this repository.
Everything in this repository seems to be 
running fine.
    Feel free to contact me at:
